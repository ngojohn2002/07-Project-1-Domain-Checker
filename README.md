# 07-Project-1-Domain-Hunter-HQ

## Description

Before registering for a domain name, business owners will need a way to check for its availability. Among other domain checkers, our colaborative project utilizes WhoisXML API's tools to access global domain registration data, allows users to quickly check if their desired domain name is still available, if taken then presents them with the current registrant's info.

## User Story

```
AS A business owner
I WANT to see if a domain name is available
SO THAT I can register for it
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a domain checker with form inputs

1. WHEN I enter a domain name to search
THEN I am presented whether the domain name is available or taken

2. WHEN a domain is taken
THEN I am presented with how old the domain is and its registered owner's contact info
```
